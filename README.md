# Setup:

- First fork, then clone this repository; you'll be able to push your changes
  back up to your forked repository in the near future.

# Lab Exercise 1

<details> <summary> View exercise 1... </summary>

# Project Summary

Review the tests in `/src/__tests__/newFunction.test.ts`.

- You'll notice the line:
  ```typescript
  import { myFunction } from "../newFunction";
  ```
- The tests run against the function that `/src/newFunction.ts` exports, which
  is blank for now.

## Instructions

- Edit the function `myFunction` in `/src/newFunction.ts` to pass the tests in
  `/src/__tests__/newFunction.test.ts`
- Execute the tests by running the command `jest newFunction`
- If the tests fail, review your error messages, and correct your function; you
  do not need to edit the tests.

## Submission

Copy and paste the content of `newFunction.ts` (NOT `newFunction.test.ts`) into
Canvas to submit this assignment.

# Lab Exercise 2

<details> <summary> View exercise 2... </summary>

# Project Summary

Your organization is in need of a date formatting function. To get som epractice
with unit testing and TDD, they have assigned you to write unit tests for the
`dateFormat` function.

Unlike the previous exercise, neither the function, nor the tests have been set
up already.

## Instructions

- Create a new test file, `/src/__tests__/dateFormat.test.ts`
- Add the mock function your developer gave you:
  ```typescript
  function dateFormat(shortDate: string): string {
    // this function will accept a numeric short date:
    // MM-DD-YYYY
    // and will return a long date, for example:
    // "2-5-2019" => "February 5, 2019"
    // "11-12-2022" => "November 12, 2022"
    return "";
  }
  ```
- Add a describe block, and then tests.
  - The comments in the code should give you everything you need for the
    function's requirements.
  - The tests from the prior exercise should give you a format to follow for
    your tests.

## Submission

Copy and paste the content of your `dateFormat.test.ts` into Canvas to submit
this assignment.

## Solution

You can review this repository's `solution` branch to view a working function
for lab exercise 1, and the tests for lab exercise 2 as well.

## Review

That's the core of TDD! Only if the requirements are wrong do the tests need
updating.

- (These tests are written accurately, so you can trust them)

The tests aren't perfect, especially when it comes to user experience, but
that's nothing new; you should always have a manual tester checking something
like that. However, for a function like this, it's perfect! Good work.

## Contributions
