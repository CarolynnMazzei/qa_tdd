# Project Summary

Review the tests in `/src/__tests__/newFunction.test.ts`.

- You'll notice the line:
  ```typescript
  import { myFunction } from "../newFunction";
  ```
- The tests run against the function that `/src/newFunction.ts` exports, which
  is blank for now.

## Step 1

- Edit the function `myFunction` in `/src/newFunction.ts` to pass the tests in
  `/src/__tests__/newFunction.test.ts`
- Execute the tests by running the command `jest newFunction`
- If the tests fail, review your error messages, and correct your function; you
  do not need to edit the tests.

## Solution

You can review this repository's `solution` branch to view a working function.

## Review

That's the core of TDD! Only if the requirements are wrong do the tests need
updating.

- (These tests are written accurately, so you can trust them)

The tests aren't perfect, especially when it comes to user experience, but
that's nothing new; you should always have a manual tester checking something
like that. However, for a function like this, it's perfect! Good work.
