# Setup:

- First fork, then clone this repository; you'll be able to push your changes
  back up to your forked repository in the near future.

# Lab Exercise 1

<details> <summary> View exercise 1... </summary>

# Project Summary

Review the tests in `/src/__tests__/newFunction.test.ts`.

- You'll notice the line:
  ```typescript
  import { myFunction } from "../newFunction";
  ```
- The tests run against the function that `/src/newFunction.ts` exports, which
  is blank for now.

## Instructions

- Edit the function `myFunction` in `/src/newFunction.ts` to pass the tests in
  `/src/__tests__/newFunction.test.ts`
- Execute the tests by running the command `jest newFunction`
- If the tests fail, review your error messages, and correct your function; you
  do not need to edit the tests.

## Submission

Copy and paste the content of `newFunction.ts` (NOT `newFunction.test.ts`) into
Canvas to submit this assignment.

# Lab Exercise 2

<details> <summary> View exercise 2... </summary>

# Project Summary

Your organization is in need of a date formatting function. To get som epractice
with unit testing and TDD, they have assigned you to write unit tests for the
`dateFormat` function.

Unlike the previous exercise, neither the function, nor the tests have been set
up already.

## Instructions

- Create a new test file, `/src/__tests__/dateFormat.test.ts`
- Add the mock function your developer gave you:
  ```typescript
  function dateFormat(shortDate: string): string {
    // this function will accept a numeric short date:
    // MM-DD-YYYY
    // and will return a long date, for example:
    // "2-5-2019" => "February 5, 2019"
    // "11-12-2022" => "November 12, 2022"
    return "";
  }
  ```
- Add a describe block, and then tests.
  - The comments in the code should give you everything you need for the
    function's requirements.
  - The tests from the prior exercise should give you a format to follow for
    your tests.

## Submission

Copy and paste the content of your `dateFormat.test.ts` into Canvas to submit
this assignment.

## Solution

You can review this repository's `solution` branch to view a working function
for lab exercise 1, and the tests for lab exercise 2 as well.

## Review

Writing tests against requirements, or code against existing tests, that's the
core of TDD, and now you have experience with both.

While you won't often write TDD unit tests (UI automation is more common for
QA), these exercises will help you to understand your developers' code, and you
can always check into what they test to inform your own tests.

Expand each exercise above for specific requirements, and don't forget to submit
your assignments. Good work!

## Contributions
